# Challenge 4 - Sharing is Caring

## Problem
Nathan, our club exec, has far too much money. In a bid to reduce his burgeoning stockpile, he decides to print a cheque for each ANDi in the club for various amounts. 
Since he's a busy guy, your task is to write an algorithm which will convert a numeric amount of money into a worded representation, to be printed on the cheque.

The winning solution (in any language) will be the one which is able to output correct representations of [these cheque values](data/amounts.txt), whilst being concise, clear and appropriately unit tested.

## Example

Given a cheque for Â£10,216,360.11, your program should output `Ten million two hundred sixteen thousand three hundred sixty pounds and eleven pence`.
