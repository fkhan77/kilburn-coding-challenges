# Challenge 5 - Easy Does It

## Problem
Your task is write a miniature game. The player is in charge of a prototype robot AND-Roid, which is sent into an active minefield. The player's task is to direct the robot with up/down/left/right commands safely through the minefield to the exit, without striking any mines.

It's expected that your game will display the map and exit to the player, but obviously not the locations of the mines.

The winning solution (in any format/language) will be the one which is the best presented, with extra kudos given for going "above and beyond" the basic requirements.

### Map key
Character | Meaning
--- | ---
`R` | Robot start position
`+` | Wall (impassable)
`#` | Empty space (passable)
`^` | Mine
`E` | Exit
